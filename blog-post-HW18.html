					<p><strong>Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable for real-time systems.</strong></p>
					<p>Object oriented and real time systems are both very complex and can sometimes be difficult to work with. Combining two hard to work with systems is asking for a disaster to happen. Since real-time systems must always be up it can be difficult to incorporate an added layer of complexity on top of the real-time system. Object oriented code can also be hard to perform unit tests on since many of the methods are in their own classes and have a level of abstraction. This makes it more difficult to find bugs that may be occurring. I myself think that object-oriented programming is worth the extra work because of the power and code reuse that comes with it but it is up to each software developer to decide what is right for their system.</p>

					<p><strong>Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete a system development, may be used to move project risk from client to contractor. If anything goes wrong, the contractor has to pay. Suggest how the use of such contracts may increase the likelihood that product risks will arise.</strong></p>
					<p>Fixed price contracts are where a contractor bids a fixed price to have a complete system finished without any additional funds added in during development. This may sound like a great way for both parties to budget and know exactly how to plan but the world of software is not so black and white. While creating the system, bugs will arise and may shift the amount of work which could potentially hurt the contractor. Also, the client may not have planned out everything that they wanted but now cannot add in anymore features since it is a fixed price. It is likely that corners will be cut due to funds running out and time running out and as we have learned previously, testing is one of the first things to be cut. Fixed price contracts seem like a bad idea for both parties since it is very possible that neither party will be happy when the job is finished.</p>
