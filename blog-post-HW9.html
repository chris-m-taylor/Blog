					<p class="mt-5"><strong>Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the wilderness weather station system.</strong></p>
					<p>Fred is a worker for a ski resort in North Carolina. His job is to report if there might be hazardous conditions for skiing throughout the day. Fred wakes up and drives up the mountain to get to his station. He then grabs a quick bite to eat then sits down at his computer to log in to the system. After typing in his login information, he is able to see the weather hour by hour and check conditions for the day. If he sees anything that might be dangerous, he can send out an alert to the ski resort attendants to shut down the park temporarily. When the weather passes, Fred can give the all clear and the attendants can reopen the slopes.</p>

					<p class="mt-5"><strong>A common approach to system testing is to test the system until the testing budget is exhausted and then deliver the system to customers. Discuss the ethics of this approach for systems that are deliver to external customers.</strong></p>
					<p>A common problem for most developers is getting the problem solved within the budget. Unfortunately, it seems the first thing to go out the window when designing a solution that is overbudget is the testing. Testing until the budget is exhausted is very unethical because it gives no motivation to the developers to develop good and robust tests. There should be a breakdown for each project and clearly state how much testing will be completed with this amount of money vs doing tests until the number of hours put into the project totals the number of hours paid for by the client.</p>

					<p class="mt-5"><strong>Reflections on Testing</strong></p>
					<p>“Testing consumes half of the labor expended to produce a working program” – Intro To Testing. The crazy thing is that if we as developers wrote code that had no bugs, there would be no reason to ever test anything. Testing can also be used to prove that the original goal has been completed or resolved. If a system is being created to solve a problem, tests can be created to pass once that problem is solved. One thing I have always done is to say debugging and testing interchangeably. This article points out that testing and debugging are two completely different things. Testing is to say to the developer, “hey this thing isn’t working correctly.” And then debugging is the developer combing through the code to find out why the thing isn’t working correctly. Testing is necessary for every system and the best systems have the best testing frameworks.</p>
