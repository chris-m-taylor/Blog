						A software should have these four traits, maintainability, dependability and security, efficiency, and acceptability. All of these traits are essential to what a professional software should possess.
					</p>


					<!-- 1.3 -->
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">1.3: What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four other attributes that may sometimes be significant.</h4>
					
					<p><b>Maintainability:</b> If you are always having to relearn code every time it needs and update or a fix, it isn’t being maintained properly. A program should be well documented to help point out what certain functions accomplish.</p>
					<p><b>Dependability and Security:</b>The software should do what it is supposed to do every time it is run without any unexpected results. If your software is unpredictable in certain situations, it is NOT dependable and needs to be fixed. Software should be difficult to steal information and difficult to inject information. If a software can be easily hacked by running a simple and KNOWN piece of malware, it is NOT secure.</p>
					<p><b>Efficiency:</b>A piece of professional software needs to be efficient. This means the software delivers what it is meant to in a reasonable amount of time. This time limit can vary depending on what exactly is being processed. A simple website page loading may take less than a second while a complex machine learning algorithm may take much longer.</p>
					<p><b>Acceptability:</b>A piece of software must be easy to understand and use for the user. It must also be compatible with other systems that are already in place.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Four other traits</h5>

					<p>A professional software may also be ethical, modern, unique, and user friendly.</p>
					<p><b>Ethical:</b> A piece of software should never be designed with malicious intent, although this is not the only ethical problem. A software may not be intentionally unethical, but as a byproduct could be unethical.</p>
					<p><b>Modern:</b>A software should be up to date with current trends and systems. This slightly ties into maintainability because it makes it possible to stay current since it is easy to update and change code.</p>
					<p><b>Unique:</b>The application should be unique and not a copy of something that already exists. That being said, it could be similar to something that exists and improve upon one or more aspects of the software.</p>
					<p><b>User Friendly:</b>This I think is one of the most important “secondary” aspects to a professional software. If your system is not user friendly, no user will want to use it. If the user struggles to learn the system the first time, that is ok. A user should NEVER have to keep relearning the system to continue to use it.</p>


					<!-- 1.8 -->
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">1.8: Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers.</h4>
					<p>If professional software engineers were held to the same standards as lawyers and doctors, that would mean a lot more college time for me. Software engineers can however have the same, if not a greater, impact on the way society changes and improves. It would be plenty if it was required for all software engineer majors to take a class solely on the ethics of the things they are creating. Understanding all the side effects and people directly affected would be valuable and substantial to creating ethical software. I think certifications might be taking it a little too far.</p>



					<!-- 1.9 -->
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-2">1.9: For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause.</h4>
					<p>The code of ethics are stated below with an example directly below each of them.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">PUBLIC — Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.</h6>
					<p>A software engineer should not create a device that crashes government systems.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">CLIENT AND EMPLOYER — Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.</h6>
					<p>If serious safety problem occurs, talk to your employer to fix it before going directly to the client. If the employer brushes it off, it may be worth announcing publicly depending on the severity of the concern.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">PRODUCT — Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.</h6>
					<p>Rigorous testing should happen before the launch of the software.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">JUDGMENT — Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.</h6>
					<p>If a client employer, or coworker asks for something unethical, private information, the software engineer should use their personal judgement to deny the information and report if necessary.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">MANAGEMENT — Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development andmaintenance.</h6>
					<p>If a security breach were to happen to users passwords. The manager should immediately tell the users there has been a breach to the system and passwords were stolen.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">PROFESSION — Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.</h6>
					<p>Leaders should lead by example to teach the next generation of leaders how to be ethical and continue a positive trend.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">COLLEAGUES — Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.</h6>
					<p>Posting answers on websites like stack overflow can help to build up fellow software engineers and help the community.</p>

					<h6 class="mt-4 mb-2">SELF — Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.</h6>
					<p>Once out of school, a software engineer should always be learning, whether that be getting certifications or taking Udemy courses. </p>



					<!-- 1.10 -->
					<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">1.10: To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.</h4>
					<p>People are constantly giving up their privacy to websites like Facebook and places like airports. They give up theses privacies to protect the majority of society. I think creating something like big brother is taking things too far. If you have ever seen Minority Report, you know what I’m talking about. Trying to predict what a person will do before they do it is very unethical. This could be considers good for the public but there is not a system in place that can’t eventually be hacked. Having this information stored without being hacked would be almost impossible. Every hacker in the world would be after the information of the day to day people.</p>
