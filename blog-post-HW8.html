					<p>A common theme of Mythical Man Month seemed to be that throwing more developers at a problem is, most of the time, the worst way to solve that problem faster. Many times developers become stuck in these large groups with multiple layers of communication leading to days before receiving any response. Scheduling can also cause a lot of problems in the software development world. If large corporations estimated the time it would take by the best case, they would never get paid for their work. Testing is another part of the article where it talked about how most of the time is spent planning and testing and the programming portion is smaller than all the other pieces. </p>
					<p>Bringing on a new developer is no easy task. For instance, a company I am currently interviewing for has a one-year onboarding process until you are “on your own” or “graduate the program”. Companies have their own systems in place, such as that things have to be done a certain way or else it won’t work. This is why many companies like to hire college graduates since they are not set in their own ways and processes of other companies. You can mold them to work within your environment rather than strip down old ways of thinking before you can build them up again. Since bringing on a new developer takes time and resources, it is not an easy answer to finishing the project faster. In most cases, getting the project done faster and bringing on another developer are completely different problems to solve and should not be grouped together.</p>
					<p>When working in a small team the communication is streamlined since there are less bodies to go through and come back before a decision can be made. While I was working with a small development company, I found that it was much easier to make progress on large projects since the only ones making the decisions were our small team and the client. Let’s compare this to much larger companies that do not employ the use of small teams. It could take days to decide what the next step of the project will be. These are days that the developers are stuck before they can make any progress on their project. These days add up to months and the months to years over enough time. Small teams even in large corporations allow the information to be streamlined and efficient.</p>
					<p>One theme of Mythical Man Month was about common misconceptions about throwing more bodies at a problem thinking it will make it easier. As we have seen, adding more developers adds a slew of different problems; and adding a developer, aside from speeding up the project, is a problem of its own. Budgeting time and scheduling is what I think is the easiest way to stay on target. It is best to not be optimistic, but practical. Computers are not optimistic, they are factual. You cannot persuade a computer to do anything, therefore you must plan for Murphy’s Law.</p>
